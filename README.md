# batocera-switch
## THIS CODE IS BEING ARCHIVED - NO NEW WORK
Due to all the changes in the Switch emulation world, and a lack of time, I have made the decision to archive this project.  It will still be available for people to see or someone to fork, but alas, its time has come.  

## General
Extends Batocera and adds switch emulation as an UNSUPPORTED ADD-ON to BATOCERA.  

Master branch is tested and currently working on Batocera 37-38. If you have v35 or lower, please upgrade Batocera as we are no longer supporting these versions.

This version of the code requires a file system for userdata that supports symlinking (EXT4, BTRFS) and is for x86_64 only!!  

This version integrates work from foclabroc, Batocera Nation, and uureel.  It does not include the bios keys.  

Controller automapping is a constant work in progress.  Autoconfiguration of controllers is now handled via [pySDL](https://github.com/py-sdl/py-sdl2) and some python magic.

## TODO
Actual Joycon support for Ryujinx (May not be possible) - Crash when joycons connected is fixed
Turn off/on rumble based on SDL support for the feature (currently just 'on')
Turn off/on motion based on SDL support for the feature (currently just 'on')

## EASY INSTALL
From a terminal window, run the following:<br>
```curl -L switch.batocera.pro | bash```

After installing, place your prod.keys and title.keys in /share/bios/switch/  
If you wish to use Ryujinx you will also need to supply the firmware zip file

## UPGRADING OLDER VERSIONS OF THIS ADD-ON NOT INSTALLED WITH THE EASY INSTALL METHOD
Delete the \system\switch folder and install this repo as normal.  There are folders in the old install that will break this version.  

## REPORTING ISSUES
Please use the controller issue templates for reporting controller issues.  For other issues, provide as much information as possible, and if it's a launch issue, please be sure to include the es_launch_stdout.log and es_launch_stderr.log log files from \system\logs

## SPECIAL THANKS
Special thanks for foclabroc, Rion, and Darknior and multiple members of the [Batocera Nation Discord](https://discord.gg/cuw5Xt7M7d) for testing things especially with the migration to SDL, [RGS] for a controller donation, and anyone else who contributes and helps me make this better.

## UPDATE 2023-06-28
Controller auto configuration has been migrated to the same versions of SDL that yuzu and ryujinx are using, utilizing the [pySDL project](https://github.com/py-sdl/py-sdl2).
